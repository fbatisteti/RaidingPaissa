# RaidingPaissa

RaidingPaissa is a fan project based on the extreme, savage, unreal and ultimate scenes of the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV. It is important to notice that this project is fan-made and the creator and collaborators have no affiliation with Square Enix or the game's development team, thus having all names, logos, images and legal stuff under legal ownership of Square Enix and its subdivisions.

## What is the Raiding Paissa?

Did you ever had an idea for a trial or raid fight for FFXIV and wish your could put it on paper, but felt like there were so many variables to keep track of that it felt inconvenient? Or even that it lacked the visual aids to properly show the fight as a whole? Then the Raiding Paissa is here to carry you to victory. <br />

Still under construction (basically just an idea that is put public to see if it happens), this web app is to be a fight script creator with visual clues. Planned languages to be used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but more can be added as needed. Currentl using this as an excuse to train some Vue.js.
